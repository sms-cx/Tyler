A simple script to tile textures in photoshop. It takes the current selected layer and tiles it a chosen amount. 

![Base texture](/examples/1.png?raw=True)

![Tiled texture](/examples/2.png)

### Issues

Merging the layers in the end won't work if the base textures is not rasterized.  

The new tiles will allways start in the left top corner and not where the base layer is currently.
