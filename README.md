A simple script to tile textures in photoshop. It takes the current selected layer and tiles it a chosen amount.

> [!Note]
>
> Merging the layers in the end won't work if the base textures is not rasterized.  
>
> The new tiles will allways start in the left top corner and not where the base layer is currently.
